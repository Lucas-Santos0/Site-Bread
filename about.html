            <p class="p3">Bread is an essential food, deeply ingrained in cultures around the world. It is mainly 
                composed of flour, water, yeast and sometimes additional ingredients such as salt, fat 
                and various grains.</p>
            <p class="p3">Bread production follows a baking process that encompasses several key steps:</p><br><br>

                    <p><b>Ingredient Combination:</b> The basic elements - flour, water, yeast and salt - 
                        are mixed into a dough. This mixing can be done manually or using devices such as 
                        mixers.</p>

                    <p><b>Kneading:</b> The dough is kneaded to increase the gluten, a 
                        protein found in the flour that provides structure and elasticity to the dough.

                        including carbon dioxide. That allows the dough to rise, resulting in a lighter and 
                        airier texture.

            <p class="p3">The world of bread is vast, offering a wide variety of tastes and flavors. Besides the traditional 
                white bread, there are the whole grain ones that are made with whole wheat flour, multigrain breads 
                with diverse types of seeds and grains, and naturally fermented breads, like the sourdough. In addition
                to providing carbohydrates, it can be a font of nutrients like vitamins, minerals and fibers, depending
                on its composition. Alongside your nutritional value, bread also holds significant cultural and social
                relevance, playing an important role in celebrations and traditions for years.</p>
